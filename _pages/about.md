I am a PhD student in Computer Science at the University of Wisconsin-Madison, advised by [Dimitris Papailiopoulos](https://papail.io/). I received my B.S. in Mathematics and B.A. in Computer Science from Rice University in 2023, advised by [Anastasios Kyrillidis](https://akyrillidis.github.io/).

I study Large Language Models, with recent focus on efficient reasoning and scaling laws.

I am also a part-time student researcher at Microsoft Research AI Frontiers Lab.
